## About this site

This website is built using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) using a customized version of the [Kyoto](https://themex.studio/kyoto/) theme from [themex.studio](https://themex.studio/).

It's updated using the [Deploy Ghost Theme](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-ghost-theme?ref=themex.studio) GitHub Action.

Blog post comments are powered by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/), via issues in this repository.

Web fonts are served by [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/), which is a privacy respecting mirror of Google Fonts that doesn't track you. 

The site also uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics, largely to see when and where traffic happens. No user data is collected from it.

Testing was conducted on various devices using latest versions of Firefox, Edge, Chrome, and Safari. Any issues with the site or its accessibility can be submitted as a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/janmaarten-a11y/janmaarten.com/issues/new/choose).
